AGT paper submission by Tom Peters and Kevin Marinelli

This repository contains data for an article in "Applied General Topology".
The title of the paper is "Exact Computation for Existence of a Knot Counterexample".

Abstract:
Previously, numerical evidence was presented of a self-intersecting B ÃÅezier curve having the unknot for its control polygon. This numerical demonstration resolved open questions in scientific visualization, but did not provide a formal proof of self-intersection. An example with a formal existence proof is given, even while the exact self-intersection point remains undetermined.
